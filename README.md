# Steve-Reich-Phase-Looper
An audio looping device inspired by the works of Steve Reich, specifically his experiments with phase looping.

This device contains four channel looping, the ability to generate random loop lengths, control the total length of the loop, and the option for user recorded or selected audio.

Perfect for creating evolving ambient landscapes, or finding strange percussive rhythms.
